#  SLP datasets 
Simultaneously-collected multimodal Lying Pose (SLP) provide a large-scale highly diverse pose images for in-bed human pose/behavior monitoring studies. 
Multiple modalities are collected simultaneously including RGB, long wave infrared (LWIR), depth and pressure map (PM), which covers any main stream modalities that have been employed in the relevant studies, so far. Multiple cover conditions including uncover, cover 1 (thin cover) and cover2 (thick cover) are also included. For dataset details and access request, please visit [SLP page at ACLab website](https://web.northeastern.edu/ostadabbas/2019/06/27/multimodal-in-bed-pose-estimation/).

This repo provides the working examples to illustrate SLP usage in:
1. Potential usage in future machine learning studies.  
2. Visualization to study the correspondence between modalities. 
3. Working example for 2D human pose estimation. 

by providing the code examples:
  
1. `eg_SLP_interface.ipynb`: a tutorial on SLP dataset interface. SLP provide flexible data interface to feed data with varying requirements including different modalities, alignment between modalities, different cover conditions, and multimodal data for collaboration with 2D pose labels. Our SLP interface provides a basic tools for data feeding in potential future studies.  

2. `eg_vis_SLP.ipynb`: a tutorial for LWIR-D-PM visualization. To understand how in-bed (i.e. at-rest) human pose affects the underlying pressure is also an interesting topic to explore the underlying causes associated with many bed-bound diseases. This tutorial shows how to visualize our dataset samples with an interactive camera control provided in jupyter notebook.
    
3. `main.py`: a working example of 2D human pose estimation with multiple candidate models provided. 

## dependencies 
This work is developed with pytorch1.4.0, CUDA10.0. Some dependencies are for visualization purpose such as visdom and plotly. 
```
scipy
matplotlib
opencv  
torch
torchvision 
scikit-image
visdom
json
plotly
jsonpatch (visdom patch)
dominate 
tqdm

```
## Setup 
1. Down SLP dataset from [SLP page at ACLab website](https://web.northeastern.edu/ostadabbas/2019/06/27/multimodal-in-bed-pose-estimation/), unzip.
2. point `opt.ds_fd` to the path where SLP is kept.
3. point `opt.output_dir` to where you want to keep all results  (default:`./output`)

Options default can be changed in `opt.py` or through arguments `--arg_name`. Following instruction will be based on default setting `./output`. 

## To use
For 2D human pose estimation. For training: 

`python main.py --modelConf config/[modelName].conf`

For testing, testing will be conduted automatically after training. 

`python main.py --modelConf config/[modelName].conf --if_test`

For each model, we provides the training scripts in `script` which is compatible for sh or slurm. Please choose the env and node setting according to your local environment.

## File structure
In each experiment,  one specific experiment folder will be created.  The model weights file (.pth) will be saved in `model_dump` subfolder. Visualization will be saved in `vis`. The test result will be saved in `result` in json format. 
```
[exp name]	
|-- module_dump:save model weights 
|-- log:	record training loss and test loss  separately, we can only check test 
|-- result:     test result of the metrics, predictions (json, npy) 
|-- vis:	the visualization result
